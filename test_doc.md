# Graph RAG Example Document

## Introduction
This is a test document for the Graph RAG example application. It demonstrates how documents are processed and linked together in a knowledge graph.

## Key Concepts

### Vector Search
Vector search enables semantic similarity matching between documents using embeddings. OpenAI's text-embedding models convert text into high-dimensional vectors.

### Graph Traversal
Graph traversal allows the system to follow relationships between documents, finding related content beyond simple similarity.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications
- **Astra DB**: Vector database with graph capabilities  
- **OpenAI**: Embeddings and language models
- **Python**: Primary programming language

## Use Cases

1. Technical documentation search
2. Research paper discovery
3. Enterprise knowledge management
4. Semantic code search

## Conclusion
Graph RAG combines the power of vector embeddings with graph relationships to create more intelligent retrieval systems.
